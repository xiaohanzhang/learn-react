# Learn React
Simple implementation of React function component and hooks

## Commands
```bash
npm start # or yarn start
```

This builds to `/dist` and runs the project in watch mode so any edits you save inside `src` causes a rebuild to `/dist`.

Then run the example inside another:

```bash
cd example
npm i # or yarn to install dependencies
npm start # or yarn start
```

To do a one-off build, use `npm run build` or `yarn build`.

To run tests, use `npm test` or `yarn test`.
